***Change log for fluxable-newmenu***
0.1: Fluxable-newmenu was adapted from the f123-newmenu script used in the F123 GNU-Linux distro.
(sometime in 2014)

0.2: Some category parsing was changed to make more logical submenus and avoid multiple listings for applications.

0.3: Development and games categories were added.

0.4: An orca configuration item was added to the main fluxable menu.
Games parsing was corrected to include some games that were missed in previous versions.

0.4.1: Filemanager is now set in configuration file.

0.5:Nov 07, 2015- Package becomes easily distributable as an basic installer and a manpage are written.
Automatic filemanager selection code is added to give best experience and avoid potentially buggy or unstable situations.  
  
0.5.1: Dec 22, 2015- Installer and manpage are improved.

0.5.2: Apr 2, 2016- Monitor toggle script added along with root menu item to run it.
New dependency: xorg-xrandr
Bash installer is now working with git files. It had been broken for over a week due to changed file name which was done to work correctly with 
Arch-Linux packaging.

0.5.3: Apr 3, 2016- User's .flluxable directory is now added from main script if it is missing.
Messaging is improved for the rare case when F-NM is not run from a graphical session.
Code tidied up a bit, and comments updated. 
 

ToDo: Add an other category for applications not included in existing categories.
Do not display orca prefferences, (configure screenreader), item on systems where orca is not present.
Work on more universal shutdown and reboot items, or fork for non systemd systems.
Minor clean up of bash installer, and inclusion of /usr/share/doc/fluxable-newmenu dir to be compatible with distro specific packages.
